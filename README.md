## Command Line Support

* [cli](https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/tree/master/src/main/java/io/vertx/core/cli): Arthas's command line interface implementation is based on cli, open sourced by vert.x

Command line support ripped from vert.x-core, also port the code (base on git hash 17ecf4c) to enable it run on both java6 and java7. Pls. refer to [official document](http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-core/java/#_vert_x_command_line_interface_api) for more information.
